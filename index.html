                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Jacob Delgado, and I'm a software developer currently studying at the University of Miami. My passion for coding started when I was in high school, and since then, I've been dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills in this field.

                    I'm proficient in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always eager to learn more about new technologies and programming languages. I've also had experience working on various projects, both independently and in teams, which has helped me to develop my problem-solving and collaboration skills.
                    
                    In addition to my technical background, I also have a bachelor's degree in International Business from Florida International University. This has given me a well-rounded perspective and the ability to approach problems from different angles.
                    
                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new places and trying out different foods. I'm also passionate about volunteering and giving back to my community.
                    
                    I'm excited to continue growing as a software developer and to be a part of the innovative and dynamic tech industry. Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.</p>
